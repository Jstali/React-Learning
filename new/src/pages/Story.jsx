          Once upon a time, in a not-so-distant future, there was a small but
          ambitious e-commerce startup called Gizmo Galaxy. It was founded by a
          young tech enthusiast named Sarah, who dreamed of creating a one-stop
          shop for all things gadgets and gizmos.

          Sarah had always been fascinated by the world of technology. From
          wireless earbuds to drones, from smartwatches to virtual reality
          headsetsâ€”if it beeped, buzzed, or flashed, she was interested. But as
          Sarah navigated through her daily life, she realized something: the
          online stores she shopped at were a mess. Some were too niche,
          focusing only on specific gadgets. Others had endless pages of
          irrelevant products
